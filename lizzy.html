  <h3>The Queen's Hobbies And Interests</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Horses
      <ul>
        <li>The Queen's first pony was given to her by her grandfather King George V - a Shetland called Peggy, marking
          the beginning of a lifelong love of horses.Her Majesty became hugely knowledgeable as a rider, owner and
          breeder of horses and her passion for them was evident at the race meetings she attended publicly, which
          regularly included the Derby at Epsom and Royal Ascot, a Royal occasion since 1711.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Dogs
      <ul>
        <li>For her eighteenth birthday, The Queen was given a Corgi named Susan from whom numerous successive dogs were
          bred. Some Corgis were crossed with dachsunds (most notably Pipkin, who belonged to Princess Margaret) to
          create ‘Dorgis’, and Her Majesty has owned Corgis and Dorgis ever since.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Dancing
      <ul>
        <li>The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh both loved Scottish country dancing. Each year, during her stay at
          Balmoral Castle, Her Majesty hosted the annual dances known as Ghillies' Balls, for neighbours, estate and
          Castle staff and members of the local community.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
